            <h3>About Sophie</h3>
            <p>Sophie was adopted July 2, 2013. She and her brother were found in a backyard, left behind by their mother. Both kitties were hungry and smaller than average for their age.</p>
                 <br>
            <p>Sophie is an old lady at heart. She is whitty and intelligent. Every day when mom gets home, she yells at her for leaving in the first place. Sophie always wants a sniff of whatever you're eating, but doesn't care to try new foods.</p>
                <br>
            <p>Sophie was named after a character in her mom's favorite movie, Howl's Moving Castle. Likewise her brother was named after mom's favorite band- Zeppelin.</p>

            <h4>A Day In The Life</h4>
            <p>Each morning at a shy 2 AM, Sophie demands to be let in after her evening stoll by sticking her paws in the security door to the house and shaking it. Once she is let in, she cuddles up at the foot of the bed with mom. Mom usually leaves for work, and that means Sophie gets to be lazy in any spot of the house. </p>
                <br>
            <p>Feeding time is any time for Sophie, her food dish is full all day long. When mom comes home, Sophie scolds her and then she's ready to play. Sophie only likes to play when mom gets home.</p>
                <br>
            <p>The rest of the evening is devoted to pets and relaxing time with mommy. Right before mom goes to bed, Sophie decides to run around like a crackhead until mom can't take it and puts her out for the night.</p>
